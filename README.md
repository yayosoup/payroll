# ðŸ§¾ Payroll System

A full-stack employee time-tracking and payroll management system built with **.NET**, **React**, **Swift**, and **AWS**.  
The platform allows employees to clock in/out via a mobile app, while administrators manage shifts, payroll, and employee data through a secure web dashboard.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

*The Payroll System consists of three integrated applications that communicate through a unified REST API:*
**Backend API** | ASP.NET Core Web API hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Handles authentication, business logic, and persistence to AWS RDS (PostgreSQL). | [payroll-backend](https://github.com/yayosoup/payroll-backend) |
**Admin Panel (Web)** React-based dashboard for HR and managers to view employees, shifts, and payroll summaries in real time. | [payroll-admin](https://github.com/yayosoup/payroll-
**iOS App (Employee)** Swift-based mobile client for employees to securely clock in/out. The app communicates with the backend via HTTPS requests. | [payroll-ios](https://github.com/yayosoup/payroll-ios) |
